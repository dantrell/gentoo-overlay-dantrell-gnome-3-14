Subject: [PATCH 212/315] systemd: call plymouth-quit if gdm fails

gdm.service Conflicts with plymouth-quit.service, so it does not run
when it normally would (because GDM wants to handle the handover from
plymouth to X11 itself). This means that if gdm fails to start for whatever
reason, plymouth is never stopped, so plymouth-quit-wait.service
never finishes. This, in turn, means that getty@tty*.service, which is
After plymouth-wait-quit.service, never starts, and there is no way to
log in locally and fix the problem (Debian bug #780257, but not
Debian-specific).

In Debian 8, not all display managers have been migrated to
participate in managing the display-manager.service symlink yet
(in particular, kdm and wdm have not), so gdm has a transitional
ExecStartPre that stops it from running if kdm or wdm is selected
as the active DM. This has the same effect of preventing plymouth
from running (Debian-specific bug #766462).

It's easy to avoid both of those situations by scheduling
plymouth-quit.service to run if gdm fails.
